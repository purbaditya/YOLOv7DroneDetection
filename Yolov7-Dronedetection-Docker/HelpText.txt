TRAIN YOUR OWN DATASET
-----------------------------------
1.  In the yolo master folder, go to the datasets folder.

2.  Create your own folder for example 'InfratecDronedetect'.

3.  In 'Infratecdronedetect' create 'images' and 'labels' folder.

4.  In 'images' and 'labels' folders create 'train', 'valid', and 'test' folders respectively.

5.  Pretrained weights (for example yolov5s6.pt) can be downloaded from original source if required.

10.  In the 'models' folder open a configuration file (.yaml), for example yolov5s.yaml, and change the number of classes parameter 'nc' to 1 or as many classes as required.

11. In the 'data' folder create a configuration file (.yaml), for example infratecdronedetect.yaml, copy the content of 'dronedetect.yaml' and change the main path, train, test, and valid paths according to your dataset name ('Infratecdronedetect','images/train','images/valid','images/test'). Change the parameter 'nc' to 1 or as many classes as required.

12. In the 'data/hyps' folder open a hyperparameter configuration file (.yaml), for example hyp.scratch-low.yaml, to look at the hyperparameters and change any of them if required.

13. Open 'train_aux.py' and set default values of parameters

14. Check the other hyperparameters (optional).

15. Run 'train_aux.py (for resolution more than 640x640)'. Select option 3 (type 3) in the terminal when prompted.

16. After training is done, rename the folder /runs/train/exp# folder to a name apppropriate to the training experiment (for example with batch size 16 or 8, with adam or SGD optimization, etc.). Any useless experiment folder exp# should be deleted.

17. After training use the final model (best.pt or last.pt) in detect.py, test.py, detect_tracker_streaming.py.

18. Check the parsed input arguments and the comments in the above files.
